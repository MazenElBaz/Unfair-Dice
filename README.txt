Exercise 2: Unfair Dice 

Included Files:
    * unfairDice.py
    * README.txt

Running Instructions:
    1. In the directory containing unfairDice.py use the command: python3 unfairDice.py

    2. Under if __name__ == "__main__", the first output block will be based on the input from Code Snippet #1 in the exercise description pdf on eClass. The second output block will be based on the input from Code Snippet #2, and the third output block will be based on the input from Code Snippet #3.
    
Notes and Assumptions:
    1. In the biased_rolls function, it doesn't test if prob_list has at least 2 elements since I am assuming you will always be entering a list with at least 2 elements. 
 
    2. The idea/method of how to map propabilities (lines 47 and 48 in my code) was discussed in class.
